Loops is a tool for generating lots of adversarial examples, created as part of my bachelor's thesis.

**This is proof of concept** code.

## Why?
Lots of techiniques for adversarial examples are aimed are minimizing distance metrics such as L2 and Lâˆž. This is good in theory, because it allows for an easy comparison between different attacks. In practice however, there are scenarious where these measures are irrelevant.

## Usage
More info along with code examples can be found in the project [wiki](https://github.com/RandomAdversary/Loops/wiki).
